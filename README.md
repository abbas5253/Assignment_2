The problem we aim to solve here is predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for the Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes regions in Algeria. The FWI is an important measure of fire danger, 
which indicates the likelihood of forest fires based on weather conditions. By using regression algorithms, we want to build a mathematical model that can understand how different weather factors (like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rain) and FWI components (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI) influence the FWI.

To achieve this, we will use the available historical data to train the regression models. This data contains information about weather conditions and corresponding FWI values for various days from June to September in 2012. Once the models are trained, we can use them to make predictions about the FWI for future dates based on the expected weather conditions.

The ultimate aim is to have accurate models that can help us predict the Fire Weather Index, which can be valuable for fire management and prevention strategies in these regions of Algeria.
